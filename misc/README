This directory contains miscellaneous things that might be useful
to users.


init.script
-----------

 A debian-flavoured initscript.  It relies upon their being a local
Unix account named s-blogspam, as the daemon is started under that UID
and in that home directory.

crontab
-------

A script which will schedule maintenance, and which again relies upon
a local s-blogspam user.


mark.cgi
--------

When installed appropriately this will allow you to view the comments
which were marked as "OK" - if a comment is obviously spam you can
click "spam" and the IP that submitted it will be blacklisted as a spam
source.

Do this every few days and you can stop new blogspam outbreaks from
that source :)
