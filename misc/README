----

This directory contains miscellaneous things that might be useful
to users.


init.script
-----------

 A debian-flavoured initscript.  It relies upon their being a local
Unix account named s-blogspam, as the daemon is started under that UID
and in that home directory.


crontab
-------

A script which will schedule maintainance, and which again relies upon
a local s-blogspam user.
