                       Blog::Spam
                    =====================

The Blog::Spam module, the associated driver, and the collection of
plugins allows you to offer an XML-RPC server which may be used to
test forum/blog comments for SPAM.

   make test
   make install


DEPENDENCIES

as dependencies in the generated Makefile.

USAGE

Once installed launch "blogspam --verbose" which should attempt to listen
upon localhost:8888.

If that succeeds then you may "cd tests && ./driver".  This will run a series
of comment tests against the local daemon.
