About
-----

  This directory contains a simple driver program "driver" which will
 read each file called "test.*"

  Each one will be parsed in turn and submitted to the RPC server on the
 localhost.

  The result of the RPC server will be compared to the expected result,
 which is included in the name.

  For example:

    test.blah.spam  ->  Should report "SPAM".
    test.foo.ok     ->  Should result in an "OK" reply from the RPC server.


Testing Remotely
----------------

  The driver will default to testing locally, but may be given a host
 on the command line:

skx@gold:~/hg/blogspam/tests$ ./driver www.steve.org.uk

  Or a host + port

skx@gold:~/hg/blogspam/tests$ ./driver www.steve.org.uk:8888
